# Arduino-Bluetooth-Controller-App

## Project Name: Java-based Arduino Bluetooth Controller

## Project Description:
The Java-based Arduino Bluetooth Controller is an application developed in Java that enables users to remotely control various Arduino-based devices using Bluetooth communication. The application utilizes the concept of Unique Identifier (UID) to establish a connection between the Java-based controller and the Arduino board. It allows users to control lights, operate servo motors, send input commands to the Arduino, and receive input information on the screen in real-time.

## Key Features:
